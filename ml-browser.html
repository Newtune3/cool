            <h1><span class="emoji">üß†</span> Machine Learning in the Browser</h1>
            
            <p>Running machine learning models directly in web browsers opens up exciting possibilities for privacy-preserving AI, offline functionality, and reduced server costs. This post explores various approaches to browser-based ML.</p>

            <h2>TensorFlow.js: The Popular Choice</h2>
            
            <p>TensorFlow.js provides a JavaScript implementation of TensorFlow that can run both in browsers and Node.js. It's great for getting started quickly with pre-trained models or training simple models directly in the browser.</p>

            <h2>WebAssembly for Performance</h2>

            <p>For more computationally intensive tasks, WebAssembly offers a path to near-native performance. You can compile existing C++ ML libraries or write custom implementations in languages like Rust.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid Approaches</h2>

            <p>The most powerful solutions often combine multiple approaches - using JavaScript for easy integration, WebAssembly for performance-critical computations, and Web Workers to avoid blocking the main thread.</p>
