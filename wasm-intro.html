            <h1><span class="emoji">ü¶Ä</span> Getting Started with Rust and WebAssembly</h1>
            
            <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) represents a significant step forward in web development, allowing us to run high-performance code written in languages like Rust directly in the browser. This post will guide you through the basics of setting up a Rust + WebAssembly project.</p>

            <h2>Why Rust + WebAssembly?</h2>
            
            <p>Rust's memory safety guarantees, zero-cost abstractions, and excellent WebAssembly tooling make it an ideal choice for Wasm development. You get near-native performance while maintaining the safety that Rust provides.</p>

            <h2>Setting Up Your First Project</h2>

            <p>We'll start with a simple example that adds two numbers - the "Hello World" of WebAssembly:</p>

            <pre><code>use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}</code></pre>

            <p>This simple function demonstrates the basic pattern: annotate your Rust functions with <code>#[wasm_bindgen]</code> to make them callable from JavaScript.</p>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>

            <p>Once you've mastered the basics, you can explore more complex applications like the Emoji Translator, which demonstrates real-world use of WebAssembly for natural language processing tasks.</p>
